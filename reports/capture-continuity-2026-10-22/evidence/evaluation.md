# Director evaluation observations

**Synthetic software evidence. Qualification incomplete; no operating permission or parameter recommendation.**

Input SHA-256: `c38ae992f184d4ea89b571e1852f4749084b288cd611429086befe62e9ef02a0`.

Every scenario is kept in its own session, level, evidence, execution, route, configuration, parameter and judge/model partition. Rates are not pooled.

| Level | Synthetic scenarios | Assessment | Direct live output | Virtual Camera live output |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| assist | 5 | incomplete | notRun | notRun |
| auto | 0 | notRun | notRun | notRun |
| backup | 0 | notRun | notRun | notRun |

## Actual replay scenario measurements

Wrong proposals and attempts are separate from commits. The replay does not label committed subject correctness or independent useful opportunities.

DirectorReplay has no Take entry point. Its zero Director cuts is structural and does not demonstrate Auto or Backup cut safety. Synthetic timeline seconds are not live exposure.
Useful-preparation coverage, wrong committed-subject rate, visible override latency and downstream presentation are unavailable. Missing values are never replaced with zero.

## C-05 shadow observations

Accepted records: 10. Explicit export validated: true.

Agreement describes operator matching, not independent correctness. Bindings are declared evaluation scope, not verified physical-route observations.

## Missing assessment evidence

- ownerFrozenPlanAndBudgets
- independentEligibleOpportunityLabels
- labelledCommittedPreparationOutcomes
- recordedValidation
- r2RigEvidence
- bothObservedLiveOutputRoutes
- perLevelSignatories

Assist, Auto and Backup remain incomplete without their required real evidence and explicit owner, event-operator and independent-reviewer sign-off. This tool never creates a qualification record.
